# NeuroCI

Note that this branch is being used to develop NeuroCI v2.0. This is marked by a number of changes from the original architecture, relying on direct communication with Slurm/SGE HPCs rather than using the CBRAIN Web Computation Platform.

The old, functional CBRAIN version of NeuroCI (v1.0) as described in the publication [(Sanz-Robinson, 2022)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9973641) can be found in the 'old-version-cbrain' branch.
